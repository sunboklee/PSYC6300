R is a free open source software. R is a language designed especially for statistical analysis. Many statistical methods are first implemented in R. R provides many tools for publication-quality data visualization (e.g., ggplot2). R provides many tools for data processing (or data wrangling) (e.g., dplyr, tidyr). Data come from diverse sources these days (e.g., microarray, EEG, fMRI, eyetrackers, facebook, twitter, many sensors, â€¦ ). 1.2 Installing R You can download and install a base distribution and packages (base R) from the official R webiste: https://www.r-project.org. About 14,000 packages extend the base R 1.3 Installing RStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can download and install the RStudio from the RStudio website: https://www.rstudio.com. 1.4 Cheat Sheets for R RStudio provides cheat sheets for R: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/.

["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (???) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
