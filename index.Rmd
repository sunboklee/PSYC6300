# R 

## Why R? 
* R is a **free** open source software.
* R is a language designed especially for **statistical analysis**. Many statistical methods are first implemented in R. 
* R provides many tools for publication-quality **data visualization** (e.g., `ggplot2`).
* R provides many tools for **data processing (or data wrangling)** (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`). Data come from diverse sources these days (e.g., microarray, EEG, fMRI, eyetrackers, facebook, twitter, many sensors, ... ).


## Installing R

* You can download and install **a base distribution and packages (base R)** from the official R webiste: [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

* About 14,000 packages **extend** the base R: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)

## Installing RStudio

* RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R. 

* You can download and install the RStudio from the RStudio website: [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com). 

* A short tour to the RStudio IDE: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 

## Cheat Sheets for R

* RStudio provides cheat sheets for R: [https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). 

## R topics covered in this course

* Base R
* tidyverse 
    * The `tidyverse` package was developed for more efficient data science in R. In the `tidyverse` package, the `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, and `purrr` packages provide many useful functions for efficient data transformation, data tidying, data visualization, and iteration, respectively.
    * Useful free R books: [https://bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org). R for Data Science [@Wickham] is a useful resource for the `tidyverse` package.
