* R is a **free** open source software.
* R is a language designed especially for **statistical analysis**. Many statistical methods are first implemented in R. 
* R provides many tools for publication-quality **data visualization** (e.g., `ggplot2`).
* R provides many tools for **data processing (or data wrangling)** (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`). Data come from diverse sources these days (e.g., microarray, EEG, fMRI, eyetrackers, facebook, twitter, many sensors, ... ).


## Installing R

* You can download and install **a base distribution and packages (base R)** from the official R webiste: [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

* About 14,000 packages **extend** the base R

## Installing RStudio

* RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 

* You can download and install the RStudio from the RStudio website: [https://www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com). 

## Cheat Sheets for R
