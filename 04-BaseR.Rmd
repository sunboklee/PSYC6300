## R Objects and Variables

- **Everything in R is stored as an object**, which is associated with a variable name. 
- An object is a technical terminology defined in **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**. (OOP is an important concept but not in this class)
- A variable name can be assigned to an object using the **assignment operator**. 

```{r}
# store a number to a variable named `a`
a <- 0.2
```

```{r}
# print a
a
```

```{r}
# store a vector to a variable named `b`
b <- c(1,4,9)
```

```{r}
# print b
b
```

```{r}
z <- 5
i <- (z * 2 + 45)/2
i
```

- We can think of the assignment operation as â€œ**evaluate** whatever is given on the **right side** of the operator, and assign (store) the result (an object of some type) of this evaluation in the variable whose name is given on the **left side**

## Data Structure

- R has **base data structures**.
- Almost all other objects are built upon base data structures. 
- R base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality: 

Dimension     |Homogeneous    |Heterogeneous
-----|-----|-----
1D  |Atomic vector  |List
2D  |Matrix   |Data frame
nD  |Array   |

![](datastructure.png)

## Vectors Come in Two Flavours

-	Atomic vectors (homogeneous)
    + All elements of an atomic vector **must be the same type**.
    + There are **6 types** of an atomic vector 
        + **Logical** (TRUE or FALSE), **integer**, **double**, and **character** (+ rarely used **complex** and **raw**)
    + Atomic vectors are usually created with `c()`, short for combine: 
        + `a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)`   # logical
        + `a <- c(1L, 6L, 5L)`   # integer
        + `a <- c(1, 2.5, 3.8)`   # double
        + `a <- c("apple", "orange")`   # character

- Lists (heterogeneous) 
    + Lists are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type. 
    + List are created by `list()`
    + `> x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE))`

## A Vector Has Three Properties

- **Type**: `typeof()` returns the type of an object. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
typeof(c(1,2,3))
```

- **Length**: `length()` returns the number of elements in a vector
```{r, echo=TRUE}
length(c(1,2,3))
```

- **Attributes**: `attributes()` returns additional arbitrary metadata
```{r, echo=TRUE}
attributes(c(1,2,3))
```

## Attributes

- All objects can have attributes to store **metadata** about the object. 
- Attributes can be considered as a **named list**. 
- Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once with `attributes()`. 
- Names are attributes of a vector. You can name a vector in two ways: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- c(x=1,y=2,z=3)   # when creating
names(a)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
names(a) <- c("l", "m", "n")   # by modifying existing names
a
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
attributes(a)    # names are attributes
```

```{r}
attributes(mtcars)
```


## Type Coercion (Conversion)

- All elements of a vector must belong to the same base data type. If that is not true, R will automatically **force** it by type coercion. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(4, 7, 23.5, 76.2, 80, "rrt")
v
```

```{r}
typeof(v)
```


- Functions can automatically convert data type. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

- You can **explicitly** convert data type with `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, and `as.logical()`. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- c(1,2,3)
a
b <- as.character(a)
b
```

## NA represents missing

```{r, echo=TRUE}
u <- c(4, 6, NA, 2)
u
```

```{r}
k <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, TRUE)
k
```



## Useful Functions for a vector 

### Generate a vector 
```{r}
# we can manually type the element of a vector using c()
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
a
```

```{r}
# c() also combine vectors
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(4,5,6)
c <- c(a, b)
c
```


```{r}
# k:n generates a vector whose elements are the sequence of numbers from k to n
1:10
```

```{r}
# seq() generates regular sequence
# seq(from, to)
seq(1, 10)
```
```{r}
# seq(from, to, by)
seq(1, 10, 2)
```

```{r}
# rep(x, times) replicates the values in x multiple times
# x can be a number or vector
# replicates 1 5 times
rep(1, 5)
```

```{r}
# replicates c(1, 2) 5 times
rep(c(1,2), 5)
```

```{r}
# each element of c(1,2) is repeated 5 times
rep(c(1,2), each = 5)
```

```{r}
# rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) generates a vector of n random samples 
# from a normal distribution with specific mean and sd. 
rnorm(100)
```

```{r}
qplot(rnorm(10000))
```


```{r}
# runif(n, min, max) generates a vector of n random samples 
# from a uniform distribution whose limits are min and max. 
runif(100, 0, 1)
```

```{r}
qplot(runif(10000, 0, 1))
```


### Indexing or subsetting a Vector

- You can access a particular element of a vector through an **index** between **square brackets** or **indexing (subsetting) operator**.

- **Positive integers** return elements at the specified positions. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- c(2,3,4,5,6,7)
x[c(3,1)]
```

- **Negative integers** omit elements at the specified positions:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x[-c(3,1)]
```


- **Logical vectors** select elements where the corresponding logical value is TRUE. This **logical indexing** is very useful because we can subset a vector or dataframe based on conditions. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x > 3
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# This is called a logical indexing, which is a very powerful tool.
# > : greater than (Logical Operators)
x[x > 3]   
```

```{r}
x[x > 3 & x < 5]
```

```{r}
# %in% operator 
# v1 %in% v2 returns a logical vector indicating 
# whether the elements of v1 are included in v2. 
c(1,2,3) %in% c(2,3,4,5,6)
```


```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
a
```

```{r}
# we replace an element of a vector using the indexing and assignment operators. 
a[3] <- 100
a
```

```{r}
a[c(1,5)] <- 100
a
```

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,NA,5,6,NA)
a
```

```{r}
# is.na indicates which elements are missing
is.na(a)  # returns TRUE when missing
```

```{r}
# Type conversion: TRUE and FALSE will be converted into 1 and 0, respectively. 
# This expression answers the question: How many NSs are in a?
sum(is.na(a))
```


```{r}
# !x = not x (negation)
!is.na(a)  # returns TRUE when not missing
```

```{r}
# This expression answers the question: How many non-NSs are in a?
sum(!is.na(a))
```


```{r}
# logical indexing
a[is.na(a)] <- 999
a
```


```{r}
# create a vector with names
a <- c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3)
a
```

```{r}
# named vector can be indexed using their names
a[c("x", "z")]
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# R uses a "recycling rule" by repeating the shorter vector
# In this example, R recycled c(TRUE, FALSE) to produce c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
i <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
a <- c(1,2,3,4)
a[i]
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# R uses a "recycling rule" by repeating the shorter vector
v1 <- c(4,5,6,7)
v2 <- c(10,10)
v1+v2
```


### Arrange a vector

```{r}
# sort(x, decreasing = FALSE) 
# By default, sort() sorts ascending order.
sort(c(5,6,4))
```

```{r}
# sorts into descending order
sort(c(5,6,4), decreasing = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# rev() provides a reversed version of its argument
rev(c(5,6,4))
```


```{r}
# rank() returns the sample ranks of the elements in a vector
rank(c(5,6,4))
```

```{r}
# order() returns a permutation which rearranges 
# its first argument into ascending or descending order. 
# What this means is order(c(5,6,4)) 
# 1) first sorts a vector in ascending order to produce c(4,5,6)
# 2) and returns the indices of the sorted element in the original vector. 
# e.g., we have 3 first b/c the index of 4 in the original vector is 3
# e.g., we have 1 first b/c the index of 5 in the original vector is 1
# e.g., we have 2 first b/c the index of 6 in the original vector is 2
order(c(5,6,4))
```


```{r}
# We use order() to sort a vector or dataframe
a <- c(5,6,4)
a[order(a)]
```

```{r}
# sort a dataframe
head(mtcars[order(mtcars$mpg), ])
```

### Vectorization of Functions

- One of the most powerful aspects of R is the vectorization of functions. 
- Many R functions can be applied to a vector of values producing an **equal-sized vector of results**. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
v <- c(1,4,25)
sqrt(v)
```


```{r}
v <- c(1,2,3)
v^2
```


```{r}
v1 <- c(4,5,6,7)
v2 <- c(10,2,1,2)
v1+v2
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# R uses a "recycling rule" by repeating the shorter vector
v1 <- c(4,5,6,7)
v2 <- c(10,2)
v1+v2
```


```{r}
# mean will be subtracted from every element of v1
v1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
v1 - mean(v1)
```


### Some more functions

```{r}
# table() creates a frequency table
a <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)
table(a)
```

```{r}
# unique() returns a vector of unique elements
unique(a)
```

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,NA,5)
```

```{r}
# By default, mean() produces NA when there's NAs in a vector
mean(a)
```

```{r}
# na.rm = TRUE removes NAs before computation
mean(a, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Factors

### What is a factor? 
- Factors are used to represent **categorical data** (e.g., gender, states).
- Factors are stored as **a vector of integer values** associated with **a set of character values** (`levels`) to use when the factor is displayed. 
- Factor have two attributes
    + the **`class()`**, "factor", which make factors behave differently from regular integer vectors, and 
    + the **`levels()`**, which defines the set of allowed values. 
    
### Creating a factor
- The function `factor()` is used to encode a numeric or character vector as a factor.  
```{r}
# levels are the set of allowed values
f1 <- factor(c(2,1,1,3,2,1,1))
f1
```

- Factors are built on top of **integers**, and have a **levels** attribute

```{r}
typeof(f1)
```

```{r}
attributes(f1)
```

- `levels()` displays the levels of a factor
```{r}
levels(f1)
```

- The factor's level is **a character vector**.
```{r}
# test for objects of type "character"
is.character(levels(f1))
```

- More test functions in R
    * https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html


- We can change levels

```{r}
levels(f1) <- c("one", "two", "three")
f1
```



- By default, the level of a factor will be displayed in alphabetical order. 
```{r}
f2 <- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"))
f2
```

```{r}
sort(f2)
```

- `levels` option can be used to change the order in which the levels will be displayed from their default sorted order

```{r}
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)
f3 <- factor(c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar"), levels = month_levels)
f3
```

```{r}
# In many cases, this is the result that we expect. 
sort(f3)
```

```{r}
table(f3)
```

```{r}
table(f2)
```


### unordered vs ordered factor

- Although the levels of a factor created by the `factor()` function has an order for displaying, the factor created by the `factor()` is called **an unordered factor** in the sense that the factor does not have any meaningful ordering structure. Comparison operators will not work with the unordered factor. Sometimes, we want to specify the meaningful order of a factor by creating **an ordered factor**. 

```{r}
# the default level is in alphabetical order 
f4 <- factor(c("high", "low", "medium", "medium", "high"))
f4
```

```{r}
sort(f4)
```

```{r}
f5 <- factor(c("high", "low", "medium", "medium", "high"), levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
f5
```

```{r}
sort(f5)
```

- `min(f5)` and `f[1] < f[3]` will produce error. 

- With `ordered = TRUE` option, the levels should be regarded as ordered. 
```{r}
f6 <- factor(c("high", "low", "medium", "medium", "high"), levels = c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered = TRUE)
f6
```

```{r}
min(f6)
```

```{r}
f6[1] > f6[2]
```

- `ordered()` function also creates **an ordered factor**.

```{r}
f7 <- ordered(c("high", "low", "medium", "medium", "high"), levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
f7
```


### Why factors? 

- Factors are an **efficient way** to store character values, because each unique character value is stored only once, and the factor itself is stored as an integer vector. 
- Factors prevent **typo** because they only allow us to input the pre-defined values. 
- Factors allow us to encode **ordering structure**. 

### Some more comments
- Be careful. Many base R functions **automatically convert** character vectors into factors. To suppress this default behavior, use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` option within a function. You can explicitly convert data type with `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, and `as.logical()`. 

### Exercise

- You have the following responses of a five-point likert scale survey item: `x <- c("Agree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree" ,"Agree", "Strongly disagree", "Neutral")`. Create an ordered factor for the **five** point likert scale responses (Notice that you don't have "Strongly agree" in `x`, but include "Strongly agree" in your factor level). 

- Using the following character vector `x = c("male", "male", "female", "male", "female")`, create a factor with levels reversed from its default levels order. 

- Run the following code and explain what the code is doing. 

```{r}
set.seed(7)
x <- rnorm(100)
cut(x, breaks = quantile(x))
```


## Lists

### What is a list? 
- A list is a **one-dimensional heterogeneou**s data structure. 
    _ Because a list is a one-dimensional data structure, we can index the element of a list using a single number. 
    - Unlike a vector, a list is a heterogeneous data structure, meaning that the element of a list can be any object in R. 
    
### Creating a list
- `list()` is used to create a list. 

```{r}
x <- list(1:6, "a", c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), c(1.2, 3.3, 4.6, 6.6))
x
```

```{r}
# str() display the internal structure of an R object
str(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```


### Why lists? 
- Because of its flexible structure, many R functions store their outputs as a list, and return the list. 
    
```{r}
# In R, lm() is a function that fits a regression model to data.
# In the following R expression, 'mpg' is a dependent variable
# and `disp` and `cyl` are independent variable. 
fit <- lm(mpg ~ disp + cyl, data = mtcars)
fit
```

```{r}
typeof(fit)
```

```{r}
str(fit)
```



### Subsetting a List

- Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector. Using `[ ]` will always return a list; `[[ ]]` and `$` let you pull out the components of the list.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my.lst <- list(stud.id=34453,      # creat a list
               stud.name="John", 
               stud.marks=c(14.3,12,15,19))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my.lst
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# [ ] extracts a sub-list 
my.lst[1]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
typeof(my.lst[1])
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# [[ ]] extracts the value of an individual element 
my.lst[[1]]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
typeof(my.lst[[1]])
```

```{r}
# my.lst[[3]] will index the third element of a list, which is a numeric vector
# my.lst[[3]][2] will index the second element of the numeric vector
my.lst[[3]][2]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# In the case of lists with named elements
# $ extracts the value of an individual element 
my.lst$stud.id
```

```{r}
typeof(my.lst$stud.id)
```


### Exercise

`fit` is a list that contains the outputs of the `lm()` function for linear regression. Explore the structure of the `fit` object using `str()`. 
```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ disp + cyl, data = mtcars)
fit
```

- Extract the coefficient of "Intercept" with indexing using a positive integer. 
- Extract the coefficient of "Intercept" with indexing using a name. 

### Data frames

- A data frame is a **list** of **equal-length vectors**. 

```{r}
head(iris)
```

```{r}
typeof(iris)
```

```{r}
str(iris)
```

### The apply family of functions
-  The `apply()` family of functions refers to `apply()`, `lapply()`, `sapply()`, `vapply()`, `mapply()`, `rapply()`, and `tapply()`.
- Why do we need them? 
    - They will make your code much **shorter** by replacing your own copy and paste
          
```{r}
# A motivating example: check the number of missing values in each column of the following data frame 'm'
m <- data.frame(matrix(c(1,2,3,4,NA,6,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA), ncol = 4))
m
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(m$X1))
sum(is.na(m$X2))
sum(is.na(m$X3))
sum(is.na(m$X4))
```

- `lapply(X, FUN)`
    - X = a list object in R
    - FUN = a function in R
- `lapply()` 
    - takes a function (FUN)
    - applies it to each element of a list (X)
    - and returns the results in the form of a list

```{r}
# This one line of code will still work even when the number of columns are 1000 or more. 
lapply(m, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

```{r}
# lapply() returns a list, whereas sapply() returns a vector, matrix, or array. 
sapply(m, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### Exercise

- How many columns in the `bfi` dataset have missing values more than 20? 

```{r}
library(psych)
```

```{r}
head(bfi)
```

## Matrices and Arrays

- matrices and arrays are **implemented as vectors** with special attributes
- Adding a **`dim()` attribute** to an atomic vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array. 

```{r}
a <- 1:6
```

```{r}
a
```

```{r}
# Get or set specific attributes of an object.
attr(a, "dim") <- c(3,2)
```

```{r}
a
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# by default, a matrix is filled by column
a <- matrix(1:6, ncol=3, nrow=2)
a
```

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:6, ncol=3)
a
```

```{r}
# a matrix can be filled by row using `byrow = TRUE`
a <- matrix(1:6, ncol=3, nrow=2, byrow = TRUE)
a
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
attributes(a)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
dim(a)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
b <- array(1:12, c(2,3,2))
b
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
dim(b)
```


-	`length()` generalises to `nrow()` and `ncol()` for matrices, and `dim()` for arrays.
-	`names()` generalises to `rownames()` and `colnames()` for matrices, and `dimnames()`, a list of character vectors, for arrays.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
results <- matrix(c(10, 30, 40, 50, 43, 56, 21, 30), 2, 4, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(results) <- c("1qrt", "2qrt", "3qrt", "4qrt")
rownames(results) <- c("store1", "store2")
results
```



## Data Frames

- A data frame is a **list** of **equal-length vectors**. 
- A data frame is the **most common way** of storing data in R. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=c("a", "b", "c"))
df
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# display the internal structure of an R object
str(df) 
```

- `data.frame()` converts strings into factors by default. 
    - This default setting can cause serious problems in some cases. 
    - `stringAsFactors = FALSE` suppresses this default setting. 
    - Using `str()` to check data types is always a good practice. 


```{r, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=c("a", "b", "c"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(df) # display the internal structure of an R object
```

## Subsetting a Matrix and Array

- You can supply 1d index for each dimension. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a) <- c("A", "B", "C")
a
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c("B", "A")]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a[1, c(2,3)]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# If you omit any dimension, you obtain full columns or rows
a[2,]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a[,3]
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a
```

```{r}
a > 3
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
a[a>3] <- NA
a
```


## Exercise

* `mtcars` is a fuel economy dataset. Subset the `mtcars` dataset such that you only keep `mpg`, `cyl`, and `gear` variables with 6 cylinders. 

* Subset the `mtcars` dataset such that you only keep `mpg`, `cyl`, `disp`, `hp`, `dart`, `wt`, `qsec`, and `am` variables with 4 or 6 cylinders. 

* Subset the `mtcars` dataset such that you only keep `mpg`, `cyl`, `disp`, `hp`, `dart`, `wt`, `qsec`, and `am` variables with 4 or 6 cylinders, and `mpg` larger than 20.  


## Combine Matrices by Columns or Rows

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# combine by columns
cbind(a,a)   
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# combine by rows
rbind(a,a)   
```

## Names of the Columns and Rows of Matrices

```{r, echo=TRUE}
colnames(a) 
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rownames(a) <- c("D", "E", "F")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rownames(a)
```

## Functions 

- R functions are a special type of **R object** designed to carry out **some operation**. 
- R functions, like mathematical functions, are applied to some set of **arguments** and produce a **result**. 
- **output = function_name(argument)**
- In R, both the arguments that we provide when we call the function and the result of the function execution are **R objects** whose type will depend on the function. 
- R functions range from simple objects implementing some standard **calculation**, e.g. calculating the square root of a number, to more complex functions that can obtain some **model** of a dataset, e.g. a neural network. 

## An Example of Functions

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# call (execute or run) the mean() function
mean(c(1,2,3,4))    
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# a will store the object returned by the mean()
a <- mean(c(1,2,3,4))   
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# mean() will not work with NA
mean(c(1,2,NA,4))     
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# When na.rm = TRUE, NA will be removed before computation
mean(c(1,2,NA,4), na.rm = TRUE)    
```


## User-Defined Functions

- We can write our own functions easily 
- function.name <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3){body}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Define se() function that calculate the standard error
se <- function(x) {
  v <- var(x)
  n <- length(x)
  return(sqrt(v/n))
}
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mySample <- rnorm(n=100, mean=20, sd=4)
se(mySample)
```

## Exercise

The follow code will generate two numeric vectors randomly sampled from N(0,1) and N(3,2). 

```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)  # generate 100 random numbers from Normal(0,1)
x2 <- rnorm(100, mean=3, sd=2)  # generate 100 random numbers from Normal(3,2)
```

Write your own function that returns (simplified) Cohen's d = $\frac{mean(x_2)-mean(x_1)}{sd(x_1)}$. Specifically, your function should get the above two vectors x1 and x2 as function arguments and return d. For fun, let's use your own name as the name of this function. Check whether your function actually work by running `your_name(x1,x2)`. 


## Some Comments on Functions

- Functions are **a fundamental building block** of R. 
- We can creat our own functions, but we usually use functions made by others. 
- Packages are **a collection of functions** made by others. 
- In many cases, our job is to build a **pipeline** of data flow by connecting many available functions. 
- To do that, we have to handle the input objects (argument) and output objects (returned objects) of functions, which requires knowledge about **data structure** (e.g., creating, subsetting). 



## Generating Sequences

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# creating a vector containing integers between 1 and 10
1:10 
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
5:0
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
seq(from=1, to=3, by=0.5)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# rep() replicates each term in formula
rep(5,3)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rep(1:2, 3)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
rep(1:2, each=3)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# gl() generates sequences involving factors
# gl(k,n), k = the number of levels, 
# n = the number of repetitions.
gl(5,3)
```


## Control Flow (if-else)

- Control flow = the order in which individual statement are executed (or evaluated)
- Selection
    + **if** (condition) expression: If the condition is `TRUE`, the expression gets executed. 
    + **if** (condition) expression1 **else** expression2: The `else` part is only executed if the condition if `FALSE`. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- -5
if (x>0) {
  print("Positive number")
} else {
  print("Negative number")
}
```

## Control Flow (for)

- **for (value in sequence) {statements}**
- `for loop` allows us to **repeat (loop)** through the elements in a vector and run the code inside the block within curly brackets. 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i^2)
}
```

## Control Flow (for)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# count the number of even numbers
x <- c(2,5,3,9,8,11,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 2 == 0)  count = count+1
}
print(count)
```
